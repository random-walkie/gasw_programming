def weather_advice(sunny: bool, rainy: bool, windy: bool, temperature: float) -> list:
    """
    This function evaluates weather conditions based on three boolean
    inputs: sunny, rainy, and windy, and one float temperature

    :param sunny: True, if it is sunny; False if it is not.
    :param rainy: True, if it is rainy; False if it is not.
    :param windy: True, if it is windy; False if it is not.
    :param temperature: Current temperature in Celsius. Must be a float.
    :return: It returns a list of advice strings based on these inputs using predefined
            advice strings provided in the script.
            If it is sunny, the function adds "Wear sun cream."
            If it is sunny and hot (temperature greater than 25Â°C), it also adds "It's hot and sunny!
            Eat some ice cream."
            If it is rainy, the function adds "Carry an umbrella." to the advice.
            If it is both rainy and windy, it adds "It's windy! Hold onto
            your umbrella tightly."
            Lastly, if it's
            windy (regardless of rain or sun), the
            function adds "Hold on to your hat."
